If you have chosen this card, 
no one around you has a crush on you yet! 
  </p>
  <p>
This card usually means interaction and sharing 
so most of the time you are still in a friend zone 
with that person. If there is anyone that you are 
close with recently, or have had a lot more interaction
 with someone recently. Y'all are most likely just friends, 
with no feelings that are more than friends. 
  </p>
  <p>
However, do not be discouraged. 
If you are looking for a relationship, 
it is suggested to continue making friends. 
Although there are no friends who have a crush on you, 
as long as you continue making new friends, 
there is a possibility of a relationship. 
  </p>
  <p>
So do ask your friends to introduce you to their friends 
or join your friends' party to make new people!
  </p>

  <p>
If you have chosen this card, 
people around you are mostly friends 
or connections! 
  </p>
  <p>
This card usually means friendship or 
social network, hardly any chance to 
develop into a romantic relationship. 
It is suggested for you to try out online dating 
or try downloading dating apps!
  </p>
  <p>
No one have a crush on you at the moment. 
There is a chance for you to meet potential 
partners online. If you are looking for a 
relationship, it is adviced that you take the 
initiative meet new people. There is a high 
chance that your next partner would be from 
online dating.

  <p>
If you have chosen this card, someone have a crush 
on you and wish to be in a romantic relationship 
with you. 
  </p>
  <p>
That is because this group of cards represent 
affactuation and good favourable impression. 
If you want to find out who that person is, there 
is a clue here. This crush is rather shy and 
introverted, hence not quite active in your social 
circle!
  </p>
  <p>
If you observe, this person might not be around you 
all the time, but whenever you need help, the 
crush will appear, but when you no longer need help, 
the crush might dissapear again. Look carefully!
  </p>

  <p>
If you have chosen this card, someone might 
have a crush on you and hopes to be in a romantic 
relationship with you!
  </p>
  <p>
That is because this set of cards usually represents 
goal and action! So at the moment, someone might 
have a crush on you. One clue here is to notice the 
one that is always asking you out and always 
chatting with you. It might seem like y'all have 
nothing much to talk but the crush just wanna have 
conversations with you. Look out for them, they are 
the ones that have a crush on you!
  </p>
  <p>
If you are looking for a relationship, try to recall 
to see if there is any "suspicious person" as 
described!
